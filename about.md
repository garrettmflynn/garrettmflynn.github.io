title: About Me
---

I'm Garrett, a software engineer based in Los Angeles, California. 

I'm passionate about making neurotechnology applications accessible to everyone, and have been building [brain-responsive applications on web technologies](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3594806.3594810) since 2019.

In my current role as **senior software engineer at [Universal Brain]**, I lead the development of our EEG-based neurotyping platform for patients with major depressive disorder.

Outside of the office, I'm an avid indoor rock climber and enjoy caring for my four cats.

My incredible partner, [Alison Kennedy](https://www.alisonikennedy.com/), and I recently got married in August 2025. She has brought many wonderful things into my lifeâ€”especially cats.
