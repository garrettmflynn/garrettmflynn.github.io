With over a year since the dissolution of Brains@Play LLC, there's only one thing I can say: **Whew, what a ride. Glad that's over!**

## What Happened?
Brains@Play was a wonderful vehicle for exploring [accessible neurotechnology development](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3594806.3594810) while a graduate student. Outside the bubble of academia, however, the harsh realities of entrepreneurship set in. 

It became quickly apparent that we'd failed to build a sustainable foundation for our business. We'd failed to set boundaries and focus on our core mission. And most importantly, we wouldn't be able to simultaneusly pursue our grandiose vision for the future while meeting the needs of our immediate clients.

Beyond poor business practices, there's a lot to say about my relationship with Josh Brewster and the lessons I learned by working with—and separating from—him during the time between my graduation and our dissolution in September 2023. 

But I'll leave that for another time.

It's also important to recognize that our dissolution occured shortly after my father took his own life in July 2023. This experience was a major turning point in my life, leading to a re-evaluation of priorities and a shift in my career trajectory.

## The Next Chapter
In the middle of our dissolution, I was working on a long-term project with [Catalyst Neuro](https://www.catalystneuro.com/) and the [Neurodata without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) (NWB) team to build a desktop app for converting neurophysiology data to the NWB data standard.

[Marientina Gotsis](https://www.marientinagotsis.com/), my MA advisor, soon connected me with with [Universal Brain](https://www.universal-brain.com/): an EEG-based neurotyping platform for patients with major depressive disorder. Their mission deeply resonated with me and aligned with my prior experience in neurotechnology development. So we began working together in a part-time capacity.

In July 2024, I formally transitioned to a full-time role as a Senior Software Engineer. At UB, I've been given the incredible opportunity to build our core technology from the ground up. 

It's been a privilege to work with such a talented team dedicated to improving the lives of those living with mental health conditions.

## What's Next?
Unfortunately, my work at UB has left little time for personal projects. 

The Brain@Play website has been refactored for archival purposes, and I've shifted my independent software development work to [Neural Interfaces](https://neuralinterfaces.com).

I'm excited for what the next chapter holds. Thank you for following along on this journey!
