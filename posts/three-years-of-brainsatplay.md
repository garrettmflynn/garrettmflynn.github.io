With the [recent dissolution of Brains@Play LLC](https://github.com/brainsatplay), I've spent a lot of time reflecting on the years between September 2020 and 2023.

## The Journey
### Before It Began
...

### 2020: The Brains@Play Initiative
...

### 2021: Brains@Play LLC
...

### 2023: Moving On  
...

## A Fresh Start
I've started working on [Brains@Play](https://brainsatplay.com) again as a personal project. 

This time, I'm focusing on building educational materials for brain-responsive applications. I'm excited to see where this new chapter takes me.
