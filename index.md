## What I Do
I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Universal Brain], where I'm leading the development of an EEG-based application for treating depression well from Day One.

### Beyond the Office
I've been rolling my own brain-responsive applications since 2019. And I want to show you how to do the same.

- [Neural Interfaces](https://neuralinterfaces.com) - A Catalog of Brain-Responsive Applications
- [Brains@Play](https://brainsatplay.com) - An API for 8 Billion Brains
- [Commoners](https://commoners.dev) - Cross-Platform Development for the Rest of Us
